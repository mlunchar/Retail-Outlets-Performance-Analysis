# Retail-Outlets-Performance-Analysis
This is the main Final Project for Practicum100 Data Analyst course.

For this project we had almost no technical information at all, so we needed to find all the information on our own from the analysis. The structure for it was developped in Decomposition step, which is stored in a separate Jupyter Notebook. Additionally, we've prepared two dashboards and a presentation.

Project description:

We have data on purchases made at the building-material retailer Home World. All of its customers have membership cards. Moreover, they can become members of the store's loyalty program for $20 per month. The program includes discounts, information on special offers, and gifts. Our task is to assess the performance of the chain's sales outlets.

Project structure:

1. General lookup. Taking a look at the datasets and making a plan for data preprocessing.
2. Data Preprocessing. Treating missing values, duplicates, and other data anomalies.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis. Studying the data at hands.
4. Statistical Data Analysis. Performing statistical hypotheses testing.
5. Overall conclusion and recommendations for business.

Dashboards created for this project on Tableau Public:

1. Number of purchases per day per shop:

2. Number of purchases per customer and per store:

Additional information:

* The project was created in Jupyter Notebook, so to run it you should have Anaconda installed. It has a Table of Contents for easier navigation.

* When downloaded, the data has to be stored in the same folder with the notebook.

This project was created by Mila Lunacharska, in April 2022.
